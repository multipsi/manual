# MultiPsi manual

This is a manual for the multireference quantum chemistry program MultiPsi. 
The program is in a pre-release version, so both it and the manual are work in progress!
We are currently writing an input system for MultiPsi but for now, the best is to run it as
a python script. This manual highlights some of the main functions of the code, and more can be found
in the [eChem](https://kthpanor.github.io/echem) e-book.
